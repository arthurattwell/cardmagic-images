# Images for cards

To serve images, `npm start`.

That will also watch for new images in the `source` folder, optimise them, and save the web-ready versions to `public`.

## Dependencies

In addition to running `npm install` to install Node modules, you also need [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) installed.
